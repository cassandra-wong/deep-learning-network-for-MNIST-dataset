# Deep Learning Network for MNIST dataset

The purpose of this project is to implement a fully-connected deep learning network with 2 hidden layers and a Softmax output layer, and will train it to classify two image data sets with 10 classes. 

The two data sets used for this project are MNIST handwritten digits data set, and MNIST fashion images data set. They can both be downloaded [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
